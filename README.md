# book-nook

Kara's book nook offers a list of my books, which include a book name, author, and favorite status (true or false). The user can request a list of current book names,
add a book, favorite a book, or delete a book. Addiitonally, the user can select a button to get either a featured quote about books or a featured book (name).

My book-nook project is written using Html/CSS, Node.js, Javascript, Express, CORS, Postman and Sequelize.
