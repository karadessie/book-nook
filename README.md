# book-nook

Kara's book nook keeps an inventory of my books. The books table includes a book title, author, and favorite status (true or false). The user can request a book count,
add a book, favorite a book, or delete a book. Additionally, the user can select a button to get either a featured quote about books or a featured book title.

My Book-Nook Foundations Capstone Project is written using Html/CSS, Node.js, Express.js, CORS, Postman and Sequelize.
